# Classification Systems (CPV, NAICS, UNSPSC, ISIC, HS)

# Introduction

In this repository the Linked Economy Ontology can be found which has been used for the modeling of the Classification Systems (CPV, NAICS, UNSPSC, ISIC, HS). Specifically the Classes, the Object and Data Type Properties of the ontologiy is presented and described. As example, SPARQL queries are provided along with a sample of their responses.

# How to use 

For the modeled Classification Systems two files are provided: 
<br> a) the OWL file of the Ontology, and 
<br> b) a document (Cookbook) presenting and describing the Classes, the Object and Data Type Properties of the Ontology while providing SPARQL queries as examples.
<br><br>
The user is encouraged to study the document of the Ontology in order to get a better insight of it. The provided SPARQL queries and their results, along with the knowledge gained by the Cookbook, are sufficient in order to provide the basic means for creating custom queries to the graph.
